                description: "Peste des petits ruminants is an internationally notifiable disease of small domestic and wild ruminants. It is caused by a Morbillivirus closely related to but distinct from rinderpest virus. The main organ systems affected are the respiratory and digestive systems. Treatment is restricted to supportive care; a vaccine is available for prevention.PPR is transmitted by close contact, and confinement favors outbreaks. Secretions and excretions of sick animals are the sources of infection. Transmission can occur during the incubation period. It is generally accepted that there is no carrier state. The common husbandry system whereby goats roam freely in urban areas contributes to transmission and maintenance of the virus. In addition, production animal handlers have been associated with the transmission of infection in numerous instances, especially during religious festivals when the high demand for animals increases the trade in infected animals.Several species of gazelle, oryx, and white-tailed deer are fully susceptible to PPR infection. These and other wild small ruminants may play a role in the epidemiology of the disease; however, few epidemiologic data are available for PPR in wild small ruminants. Cattle, buffalo, and pigs can become naturally or experimentally infected with PPR virus, but these species are dead-end hosts, because they exhibit no clinical signs and do not transmit the virus to other in-contact animals of any species.",
